  Any and all disputes, controversies or claims (each a "Dispute") arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, any dispute regarding its arbitrability, validity or termination, or the performance or breach thereof, will be exclusively and finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") before a single arbitrator. Either party may initiate arbitration by notice to the other party (a "Request for Arbitration"). The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the AAA rules governing commercial arbitration in effect at the time of the arbitration, except as they may be modified by the provisions of this Agreement. The place of the arbitration will be Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The arbitrator will apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of the Commonwealth of Kentucky without reference to its internal conflicts of laws principles and will be without power to apply any different substantive law. The arbitrator will render an award and include the costs related to the arbitration and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses to the prevailing party.
